# VPN-IPsec-Implementation
CECS579 Final Project

This rep is about the final project for the CECS579 (Information Security) class I take at Cal State Long Beach.
The overall purpose of the project is the implementation of a VPN IPsec connection between two VPN gateways.
In this case the devices are Palo Alto Firewalls, the config files just contain the necessary configs for the VPN
configuration and the needed ruleset.
